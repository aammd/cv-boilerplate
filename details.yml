# Sections

intro: I am passionate about community ecology, data analysis, and open science. I am currently a postdoc with the Centre de synthèse et d'analyse sur la biodiversité (CESAB), based in Toulouse, France. My project synthesizes data from multiple scientists, using a large SQL database, reproducible workflows, and custom-made R packages. Our goal is to understand how functional traits of organisms determine how food webs respond to environmental gradients.
